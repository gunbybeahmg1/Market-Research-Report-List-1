<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air filters for Paint Booth Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coarse Filter</li><li>HEPA/ULPA Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The air filters for paint booths are crucial in maintaining a clean environment during the painting process. Coarse filters capture larger particles, such as dust and debris, preventing them from contaminating the air and painted surfaces. In contrast, HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) and ULPA (Ultra-Low Penetration Air) filters provide a higher level of filtration, effectively trapping smaller particles, allergens, and hazardous substances. This dual system ensures both basic filtration and enhanced air quality, essential for achieving quality finishes and safety in painting operations.</p></p>
