<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Photoresist for PCB Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid photoresist is a crucial material in PCB manufacturing, serving as a light-sensitive coating that outlines circuit patterns. There are two main types: positive photoresist and negative photoresist. Positive photoresist becomes soluble when exposed to light, allowing the unexposed areas to be washed away, creating detailed circuit designs. In contrast, negative photoresist hardens upon exposure, meaning the exposed areas remain while the unexposed regions are washed away. Both types offer unique advantages, catering to different design and manufacturing requirements in the PCB market.</p></p>
